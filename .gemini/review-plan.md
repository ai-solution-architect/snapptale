## Session 1: Suitability of the Proposed Product

### Description of the Review Plan
This session reviews the project's foundational concept and its alignment with the stated goals of a capstone MVP.

### Start, Implementation, and Conclusion Guide

*   **Start:** Read Section 1, "Suitability of the Proposed Product," in the implementation plan. The goal is to confirm that the project's high-level description is consistent across key documentation.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Verify that the project overview in `GEMINI.md` aligns with the product description.
    *   Check if the `README.md` reflects the core concept of an AI-powered storybook generator.
    *   **Finding:** The conceptual framework is sound and consistently described. It establishes a clear and suitable foundation for a capstone project.
*   **Conclusion:** The project's suitability is well-defined and justified. The review of this session is complete.

## Session 2: One-Week, Two-Hour/Day Implementation Plan

### Description of the Review Plan
This session will meticulously review the day-by-day implementation schedule, comparing the planned tasks with the actual artifacts present in the repository.

### Start, Implementation, and Conclusion Guide

*   **Start:** Read Section 2, focusing on the "Day-by-Day Schedule." For each day, read the corresponding `schedule/day-XX.md` file and then inspect the project repository for the implemented code.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Day 1: Project Scaffolding:**
        *   **Plan:** Basic UI wireframe and project scaffolding.
        *   **Verification:** Check for `package.json`, `next.config.ts`, `src/app/layout.tsx`, and `src/app/page.tsx`.
        *   **Finding:** **Done.** The core Next.js project structure is in place and matches the requirements.
    *   **Day 2: Photo Upload & Validation:**
        *   **Plan:** Implement photo upload functionality and safe upload validation.
        *   **Verification:** Check for `src/app/upload/page.tsx` and the `src/hooks/useFilePreview.ts` hook.
        *   **Finding:** **Done.** The upload page and file preview hook exist, fulfilling the plan's requirements.
    *   **Day 3: Image Generation API Integration:**
        *   **Plan:** Set up API keys and integrate the image generation API.
        *   **Verification:** Look for `src/app/api/upload/route.ts` and analyze its content for API integration logic.
        *   **Finding:** **Partially Done.** The API route `src/app/api/upload/route.ts` exists, creating the necessary endpoint. However, the content needs to be reviewed to confirm the full integration of an image generation service.
    *   **Day 4: LLM Story Generation:**
        *   **Plan:** Integrate the LLM for story generation.
        *   **Verification:** Analyze `src/app/api/upload/route.ts` for logic related to text generation.
        *   **Finding:** **To Be Verified.** The implementation of the story generation logic within the existing API route needs to be confirmed.
    *   **Day 5: Multi-Chapter Story Generation:**
        *   **Plan:** Generate a multi-chapter story and pull associated images.
        *   **Verification:** Review the API logic to see if it handles the creation of a structured, multi-part story.
        *   **Finding:** **To Be Verified.** It is unclear if the current implementation supports generating a full, chapter-based story.
    *   **Days 6, 7, 8: PDF Generation, Polish, and Docs:**
        *   **Plan:** These days are noted in the plan but do not have detailed schedule files yet.
        *   **Verification:** Check `package.json` for any PDF-related libraries.
        *   **Finding:** **Not Started.** These are future tasks as per the implementation plan.
*   **Conclusion:** The project has successfully implemented the foundational features for Days 1 and 2. Day 3 is partially complete, while the work for Days 4-8 remains to be verified or started.

## Session 3: Maximizing Capstone Grading Rubric

### Description of the Review Plan
This session assesses the project against the criteria outlined for achieving high marks, such as technical depth, user experience, and safety.

### Start, Implementation, and Conclusion Guide

*   **Start:** Read Section 3, "Maximizing Capstone Grading Rubric," and identify the key deliverables proposed.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Technical Depth:** Review `src/app/api/upload/route.ts` for modularity and error handling.
    *   **User Experience:** Inspect `src/app/upload/page.tsx` for progress indicators and graceful error messages. Check `src/app/page.tsx` for a "Try Example" button.
    *   **Business/Impact:** Look for a freemium/paywall toggle in the UI.
    *   **Ethical & Safety Design:** Check `README.md` or `GEMINI.md` for a dedicated safety section.
    *   **Documentation:** Verify the `README.md` contains clear setup and test instructions.
*   **Conclusion:** This session requires a deeper analysis of the existing code to determine if these value-add features have been implemented or if they remain as future work.
