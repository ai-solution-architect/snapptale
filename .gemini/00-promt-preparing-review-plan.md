As a phd professor expert in document revision, review a document following the baby steps
1 - Read carefully the document to be revised and understand its goals and its main categories and sessions.  And remember, your review will be divided per session, where each session will have a start, an implementation, and a conclusion step.
2 - Create a file called review-plan.md and add to it a plan to review session by session. For each session, you will add as a step or phase, where you will run the following steps:
  2.1 Each session will be a step that will start with a title with a clear name about the session or category
  2.2 Each session will have a description of the review plan
  2.3 Each session must have a start, implementation, and conclusion guide
3 - During the review starting phase of the session, you must go to the file to be reviewed and only read carefully the session related to the investigation, understand that, and only after go to the project content in the snapptale repository and using your granted comands like, ls, cat, git diff or git log, etc to compare the implemented code with the session that is being reviwed.
4 - During the review implementation, you will add to the review-plan.md all information found that was implemented, like the reviewed document, the ones that were not done, and the ones done differently. Remember that this is a planning document; it means that you must write in a way that the reader will know exactly what needs to be done. Please add all information relevant for future analyses.
5 - During the conclusion step, you will save the changes in the review-plan.md and go back to the reviewd file looking for the next session to review. 

Remember, it must work like a loop, where you will only review the session proposed only when really relevant you can go back to the past sessions (eg. when you find in a session a process that was implemented in a previous session, in this case is important to mention).

When you finish the review, ask for external  human validation
