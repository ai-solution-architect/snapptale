## 1. Suitability of the Proposed Product

**This AI-powered storybook generator is a strong fit for a capstone MVP project**, scoring high for originality, technical challenge, and real-life relevance:

- **Clear AI Application:** Combines generative AI for both text (story) and image (illustration) using existing, robust APIs as required for modern AI MVPs.[^1]
- **User-Centric Solution:** Addresses an engaging problem (personalized content for children) with strong potential for positive feedback, user validation, and practical demo scenarios.
- **Modular and Scalable:** The workflow is easily decomposed into discrete steps (upload, detect, generate, export), which is ideal for phased implementation over one week. Each step can be delivered using simple, widely available frameworks, as expected in a capstone.[^1]


### Capstone Alignment

Per typical capstone requirements (such as delivering “a complete, functional MVP; practical implementation over theoretical novelty; showing end-to-end value; and solid documentation”), this concept checks all boxes:

- **Completeness:** The product covers all critical flows: user input, AI-driven transformation, and content export.
- **Practical Feasibility:** Work relies on mature third-party APIs (no custom model training), reducing technical complexity.[^1]
- **Monetization Thought:** Freemium/subscription pathways are sketched, which matches capstone expectations around business viability.[^1]
- **Safety & Ethics:** Built-in requirements for image and story moderation address ethical and safety considerations mandated in most AI coursework.[^1]

## 2. One-Week, Two-Hour/Day Implementation Plan

**The project can be delivered in one week at 2 hrs/day by sharply narrowing scope and adopting aggressive MVP discipline.** Here’s how to adapt the plan for speed without sacrificing grading opportunities:

### Adapted MVP Scope

- **Web-Only MVP:** Build a simple web app (Next.js or React), not mobile, to maximize delivery speed with minimal setup. Mobile frameworks may slow you down.
- **Single AI Provider Each:** Use one image generation API (NanoBanana or Gemini 2.5 Flash) and one story generation API (e.g., OpenAI or Gemini text). Avoid integrating multiple models or allowing model selection at MVP phase.[^1]
- **Preset Artistic Styles:** Offer only two or three hand-picked styles, not full customization. Hardcode prompt templates for artistic consistency.
- **Chapter & Illustration Limit:** Limit stories to three chapters per book, with one illustration per chapter. State clearly in the demo and docs that extension is trivial for post-MVP.[^1]
- **Basic Moderation:** Integrate a simple moderation service (off-the-shelf API, such as Google Cloud Vision SafeSearch) with mandatory checks, but do not build a bespoke system. Use child/PG-rated prompts for LLM and image models.[^1]
- **Export Functionality:** Provide only downloadable PDF exports; skip HTML/book reader features for launch. Use a well-documented export library to speed delivery.
- **UI:** Use a stripped-down, single-page React interface: 1. Upload photo, 2. Name child, 3. Click “Generate Book”, 4. Download PDF.


### Day-by-Day Schedule

| Day | Milestone (2 hours max) |
| :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Project scaffolding, basic UI wireframe [Day 01](schedule/day-01.md)|
| 2 | Photo upload, safe upload validation [Day 02](schedule/day-02.md)|
| 3 | Set up API keys, integrate image generation API, process photo [Day 03](schedule/day-03.md)|
| 4 | Integrate LLM story generation, join flows [Day 04](schedule/day-04.md)|
| 5 | Generate multi-chapter story and pull images [Day 05](schedule/day-05.md)|
| 6 | Assemble story+images into PDF, offer download [Day 06](schedule/day-06.md)|
| 7 | Bug fixing, polish, write documentation/demo [Day 07](schedule/day-07.md)|

## 3. Maximizing Capstone Grading Rubric

To earn **maximum points on each rubric dimension**, adapt the solution as follows:

### a. **Technical Depth**

- **Show clear, modular backend architecture** (diagram/dataflow in documentation): Explain how modularity supports easy feature upgrades post-MVP.
- **Demonstrate robust error handling:** Illustrate how all user/API errors, moderation failures, and timeouts are handled gracefully.
- **Emphasize use of production-grade third-party APIs:** Briefly compare API alternatives and justify the choices for image/text safety, cost, and reliability.


### b. **User Experience**

- **Accessible UI/UX:** Ensure the app’s flow is intuitive, with progress spinner, clear error messages, and downloadable assets.
- **Include demo content:** Offer a “Try Example” button loaded with dummy photo/story, so reviewers can test without uploading a real photo.


### c. **Business/Impact**

- **Freemium/Paywall Demo:** Show a working toggle (fake for MVP) between “Free” and “Premium”—for full book or higher-res download, with annotation in the UI and code to show where to connect payments for future work.
- **Evidence of User Validation:** Create a simple “sign up for launch news” form on the landing page and showcase at least a few unit/integration test results for extra credit.


### d. **Ethical & Safety Design**

- **Dedicated safety section in final doc:** Quote which models/services are used and how explicit prompt engineering and moderation ensures child-safe outputs.
- **API usage limits shown** (e.g., “Free tier: 1 book per day” printed in UI).


### e. **Documentation & Demo**

- **Provide code README** with setup, deployment, and test instructions.
- **In your demo, walk through the step-by-step flow and highlight error handling and moderation.**
- **Reference industry/academic parallels:** Briefly mention in documentation how the project is conceptually inspired by Llamagen.ai, Canva’s story generator, and BrandInAMinute to show domain knowledge.[^1]

## Ready-Made Capstone Submission Table

| Rubric Category | How This MVP Scores Max Points |
| :-- | :-- |
| Completeness | End-to-end demoable flow, clean minimal UI, documentation, setup scripts |
| Technical Challenge | Non-trivial flow coordination, API orchestration, robust async handling |
| Market/User Understanding | Landing page, fake signup, demo of user journey |
| Ethics/Safety | API moderation, prompt engineering, in-code safeguards |
| Business/Monetization | Demo freemium toggle, visible code stubs for paywall, pricing in UI |
| Testing/Demo Quality | Clean code, graceful fail/happy path, concise video (if required) |

## Final Summary

**This product is highly suitable and can be implemented to a demo-ready MVP standard within a week by focusing on core modules, hard-coding stylistic options, and using 3rd-party AI APIs.** Emphasize code modularity, robust error handling, explicit mention of moderation, and practical business triggers to maximize capstone scoring. Ensure the README/demo not only proves it works but highlights the thoughtful capstone-oriented design (user safety, clear use of best industry building blocks, and future scalability).[^1]

**All claims above draw on best practices distilled from real AI MVP case studies and the capstone’s emphasis on deliverability, usability, ethics, and professionalism**.[^1]
