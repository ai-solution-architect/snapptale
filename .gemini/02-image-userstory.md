 "As a user, when I upload a photo (ideally featuring a child or a main subject) and provide a name, the application should
   use AI to:
   1. Analyze the uploaded photo to identify the primary human character. If multiple people are present, it should
      intelligently select one as the main protagonist. If no human is detected, it should still generate a captivating
      story based on other prominent elements in the photo.
   2. Generate a personalized, multi-chapter story where the identified main character (or the captivating element) is the
      central figure, ensuring the narrative is engaging and child-friendly.
   3. For each chapter, generate a unique illustration that visually integrates the main character (or the key element) and
      aligns with the story content.
   4. Finally, assemble these into a downloadable PDF storybook."
